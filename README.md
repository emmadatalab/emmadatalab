# Hi, I'm Emma

With several years of experience in digital marketing and SEO, I developed a strong foundation in working with data, performance metrics, and user behavior at scale. Over time, this analytical approach led me to pursue data analytics more seriously — with a focus on solving complex problems in financial environments. I’ve since transitioned into a more technical path, combining data analysis skills with a strong interest in financial markets, trading activity, and platform-level optimization.

## What I Do

I focus on leveraging data to solve real-world challenges within financial platforms — from brokers and exchanges to fintech products. I analyze user behavior, trading activity, and performance metrics to uncover inefficiencies, identify growth opportunities, and support data-driven decision-making across operations, product, and marketing functions.

I work with SQL and Python to extract and transform large-scale financial and behavioral datasets. My toolbox includes exploratory data analysis, time-series modeling, and technical analysis — not only to study market dynamics and price behavior, but also to understand liquidity flows, volatility trends, and client segmentation.

In parallel, I’m deepening my knowledge in machine learning to develop smarter analytics tools for financial platforms — including predictive modeling, anomaly detection, and behavioral clustering — with a long-term interest in strategy backtesting and intelligent decision systems.
